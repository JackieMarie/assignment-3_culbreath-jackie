### Comments
I thought I had a grasp on BEM, and even wrote about it for my Discussion 1 assignment. However, in this assignment I realized I am still somewhat confused on how to name items correctly. For example, should the block name always be the semantic tag? I assume not, since we will have a main tag on another html file that might be styled slightly differently. But I am not sure of the best way to name it. Suggestions are appreciated!
